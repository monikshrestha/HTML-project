			The use of the term "technology" has changed significantly over the last 200 years. Before the 20th century, 
			the term was uncommon in English, and it was used either to refer to the description or study of the useful arts, 
			as in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The simplest form of technology is the development and use of basic tools. 
			The prehistoric discovery of how to control fire and the later Neolithic Revolution increased the available sources of food,
			and the invention of the wheel helped humans to travel in and control their environment. Development in telephone, internet 
			printing press have lessend physical barrier in communication and allowed humans to interact with each other in global scale.
			Technology runs our lives these days. Smartphones, tablets and computers – we really can’t seem to function without them. 
			In a very short amount of time, technology has exploded in the market and now, many people cannot imagine a life without it.

			Much of the technology we take for granted today stems from 50 years ago. In 1968 we saw Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore launch pioneering semiconductor company, Intel,
			as well as the first large-scale test of RAND researcher Paul Baran’s distributed communications network ARPANET. 
			Originally intended for scientists and researchers who wanted to share computers remotely,
			ARPANET quickly turned into something far greater: the Internet.n the last 50 years, technology advancements born out of 1960s innovation have changed the global landscape dramatically. 
			As developments in areas such as artificial intelligence (AI), big data and the Internet of Things (IoT) converge,
			we find ourselves at the beginning of a new era of innovation.<br>
			Technology has influenced a lot in our modern day society. Technology development has helped humans in lot of ways.

            <h3>Technology We Use Daily</h3>
				
			<p>
				We apply technology in almost everything we do in our day to day life. We use technology for our work,
				for communication, transportation, learning, etc. Technology helps us human to sustain our day to day life.<br>
				Many organization use technology to stay competitive and deliver their services to the customers using technology.<br>
				Their are many types of technology, but the most impact on our day to day life is given by Communication Technology, 
				Entertainment Technology and Information Technology. <br>
				This use of technology to create an entertainment experience. Since entertainment is too broad, everyone gets entertained in their way. 
				Technology is used to create video games, to develop musical systems and so much more. Works which takes hours to complete are made easier. 
				Mathematical problems can be solved easily which were difficult in the past and took lot of time . 
				Due to technology we can carry a small computers in our pockets or in our bags, and can use it anywhere we like.
